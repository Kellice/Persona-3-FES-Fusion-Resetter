Hello, and welcome to the readme for my goofy little program!
This program is intended to be able to automatically reset a persona fusion in Persona 3 FES and determine
what skills it has and whether or not it should be kept.
I wrote this in PyCharm in about a week and with no experience in programming at all, so there are likely
more efficient ways to do what this does.
I have not tested the program in Persona 3 Original and Persona 3 Portable, but I would assume that it
should also work for those games if you set it up correctly.
This program works by taking a screenshot of the game window in an emulator, then using an OCR to read the
screenshot and determine what skills it has.
As I mentioned, I have no experience with programming, so there is no UI at all.
Everything will need to be input directly into the program, so you will need an IDE that can both edit and
run python projects.
I have inlcuded comments in the code to hopefully explain everything that would need to be done, but I expect
it may not be comprehensive enough.
I may work on adding a UI and properly packing the program into an executable file, but that is for another day.
If you run into any issues, try to contact me on GitHub if at all possible.
I'm not very familiar with its workings, but hopefully it should work.

Also, in case you're wondering, TheGrinder is my pet name for the project.
I named it as such since it reminds me of the monster grinder from Backyard Monsters, which is a very specific
reference from a few years ago.
